# Projects 2022 Technical Screening - kmjacinto2145

Hey, thanks for taking the time to check and review my code for the technical screening. I've completed both the easy and hard challenges (but I've yet to check my solution to the hard problem with more advanced tests!). The hard problem was a fun challenge and ultimately it was quite straightforward once I understood all the patterns and found a way to convert the conditions to a boolean expression.

Please note that I worked on the original versions of the two challenges, prior to any edits (e.g. the COMP6443 typo in conditions.json). I will update this README if I make any  edits to my code in light of these changes.

Hopefully looking forward to working with CSESoc Projects in 2022!
