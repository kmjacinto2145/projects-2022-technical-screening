# Projects 2022 Technical Screening - Michael Jacinto

Hey, thanks for taking the time to check and review my code for the technical screening. I've completed both the easy and hard challenges (but I've yet to check my solution to the hard problem with more advanced tests!). The hard problem was a fun challenge and ultimately it was quite straightforward once I understood all the patterns and found a way to convert the conditions to a boolean expression.

Hopefully looking forward to working with CSESoc Projects in 2022!
